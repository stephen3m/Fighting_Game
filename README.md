## Introduction
This was a project I worked on during summer of 2022 that simulates a classic arcade fighting game where two players can fight against each other on the keyboard (Player 1 uses WASD and Player 2 uses the arrow keys). This project uses JavaScript to code the basic fighting game mechanics and HTML Canvas to create the graphics of my game.
